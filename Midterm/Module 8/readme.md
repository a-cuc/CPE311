<h1> Summary of Learnings 🧩 </h1>

I learned that data could also be collected from a database 🖥️ using sqlite3, and that we could exploit its strengths such as joining in pandas.

Related to joining 🖇️, I have learned that knowledge 🧠 of the join types to use is essential as there could be data loss if improper joins were used.

I also learned that there are many methods 📝 in pandas which makes manipulating data easier and faster.

Finally, I learned that dealing with date and time ⌚ is trickier as there could be differences in how often the data is recorded, and knowing how to handle
this with the methods given by pandas is important.
